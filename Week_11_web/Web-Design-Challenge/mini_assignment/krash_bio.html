    <p>Well.... Class 189 took a little trip<br>
        along with our instructors down the Coranado Strip,<br>
        we ate a'lot a power-bars and carried our canteens<br>
        and we ran the bloody beaches at a pace made us scream!
    </p>
    <p> ... Then we ...<br>
        Dropped and pushed 'em out, but they said to keep 'em comin,<br>
        we weren't near as many as we were a while ago,<br>
        we dropped once more and then began a runnin,<br>
        Down from Coranado to the edge of Mexico!
    </p>
    <p> Well we ran through the ditches and we ran on the beaches<br>
        and we ran on the berm where the army wouldn't go,<br>
        we ran so fast our instructors couldn't catch us,<br>
        then we swam are asses back from the edge of Mexico! Hooyah!
    </p>
