# Number Chain

Chain up the numbers

## Instructions

* Using a while loop, ask the user "How many numbers?", then print out a chain of ascending numbers, starting at 0.

* After the results have printed ask the user if they would like to continue.

  * If "y", restart the process, starting at 0 again.

  * If "n", exit the chain.

* NOTE: Rather than just displaying numbers constantly starting at 0, have the numbers begin at the end of the previous chain.

Sample output can look like this:

```
How many numbers? 9
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

Continue the chain: (y)es or (n)o? y

How many numbers? 8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16

Continue the chain: (y)es or (n)o? 
```
